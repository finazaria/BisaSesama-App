## About

BisaSesama is a web application that allows users to open fundraisers and make donations to help others. It can display data related to fundraising that has been made, fundraising that can be donated, and the number of donations that have been collected. You can also display fundraising data by category, such as health, natural disasters, and places of worship.

As the main goal of this coursework, we were expected to design our own database by making queries for the GET, POST, UPDATE, and DELETE methods. We were also required to make the triggers for the web application.

Hence, BisaSesama is developed under the backend framework that we developed by ourselves, without using any frameworks that are commonly used, such as Django or Springboot.

The programming languages we use to create this web application are Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
